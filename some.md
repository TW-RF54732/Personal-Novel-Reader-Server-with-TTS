Okay, excellent! Building an AI agent is a great project, and I can definitely be a valuable component. Here's a
breakdown of what I can do for your agent, how to work with me, and important considerations:

**What I Can Do for Your AI Agent:**

* **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):**  This is my core strength. I can:
    * **Parse user input:**  Understand what a user *means* even if they don't phrase it perfectly.
    * **Intent Recognition:**  Identify the *goal* of the user's request (e.g., "book a flight," "get the
weather," "set a reminder").
    * **Entity Extraction:**  Identify key pieces of information within the user's input (e.g., city names, dates,
times, product names).
* **Natural Language Generation (NLG):** I can:
    * **Formulate responses:**  Create human-like, coherent, and contextually appropriate responses to user
requests.
